svn
This file contains the version number of the gateway.
It is stored on the first line. Nothing else should
be there. 

Note that if you get this file from SVN, it will just
say "svn-r<revision>" instead of a version number. 
This is intentional, it avoids confusion with real releases.

Starting with version 0.8, version numbers that have an even
second part are STABLE versions and those with odd ones are
DEVELOPMENT versions. Thus, 1.0 is stable, 1.1 is development.
Don't use development versions for production unless you
really know what you do.
