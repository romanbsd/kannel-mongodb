/********************* Memory debugging routines ************************/

/* These macros and functions are used in debugging memory usage of
 * the compiler and to find out memory leaks.  When these functions
 * are used, each dynamically allocated block is recorded in a list of
 * active blocks, and allocated blocks are tagged with information
 * about their allocation location.  When the block is freed, it is
 * removed from the list and its contents is marked freed.  Typically
 * these functions detect memory leaks and freeing same memory block
 * multiple times.
 *  
 * These functions can also be used to test error recovery code of
 * memory allocation failures.  The function ws_clear_leaks() clears
 * the current information about used blocks and it sets the limit of
 * successful memory allocations.  When more than the limit number of
 * memory allocations have been performed, all memory allocations
 * fail.  When the tested function has returned, you can see if you
 * cleanup code did not free all blocks by using the functions
 * ws_hash_leaks() and ws_dump_blocks().
 *  
 * These functions are not thread safe.  They use shared static list
 * to record the active blocks and they do not use any sorts of
 * locking.
