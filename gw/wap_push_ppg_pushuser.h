 * This function does authentication possible before compiling the control 
 * document. This means:
 *           a) password authentication by url or by headers (it is, by basic
 *              authentication response, see rfc 2617, chapter 2) 
 *           b) if this does not work, basic authentication by challenge - 
 *              response 
 *           c) enforcing various ip lists
 *
 * Check does ppg allows a connection from this at all, then try to find username 
 * and password from headers, then from url. If both fails, try basic authentica-
 * tion. Then check does this user allow a push from this ip, then check the pass-
 * word.
 *
 * For protection against brute force and partial protection for denial of serv-
 * ice attacks, an exponential backup algorithm is used. Time when a specific ip  
 * is allowed to reconnect, is stored in Dict next_try. If an ip tries to recon-
 * nect before this (three attemps are allowed, then exponential seconds are add-
 * ed to the limit) we make a new challenge. We do the corresponding check before
 * testing passwords; after all, it is an authorization failure that causes a new
 * challenge. 
 *
 * Rfc 2617, chapter 1 states that if we do not accept credentials of an user's, 
 * we must send a new challenge to the user.
 *
 * Output an authenticated username.
 * This function should be called only when there are a push users list; the 
 * caller is responsible for this.
