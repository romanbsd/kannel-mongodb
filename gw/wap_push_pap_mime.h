/*
 * Implementation of the external function, PAP uses MIME type multipart/
 * related to communicate a push message and related control information from 
 * pi to ppg. Mime_parse separates parts of message and in addition returns
 * MIME-part-headers of the content entity. Preamble and epilogue of are dis-
 * carded from control messages, but not from a multipart content entity.
 * Multipart/related content type is defined in rfc 2046, chapters 5.1, 5.1.1, 
 * and 5.1.7. Grammar is capitulated in rfc 2046 appendix A and in rfc 822, 
 * appendix D. Functions called by mime_parse remove parsed parts from the mime
 * content. 
 * Input: pointer to mime boundary and mime content
 * Output: in all cases, pointer to pap control document and push data. If 
 * there is a capabilities document, pointer to this is returned, too. If there
 * is none, pointer to NULL instead.
 * In addition, return 1 if parsing was succesfull, 0 otherwise.
