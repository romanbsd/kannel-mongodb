/*
 * urltrans.h - URL translations
 *
 * The SMS gateway receives service requests sent as SMS messages and uses
 * a web server to actually perform the requests. The first word of the
 * SMS message usually specifies the service, and for each service there is
 * a URL that specifies the web page or cgi-bin that performs the service. 
 * Thus, in effect, the gateway `translates' SMS messages to URLs.
 *
 * urltrans.h and urltrans.c implement a data structure for holding a list
 * of translations and formatting a SMS request into a URL. It is used as
 * follows:
 *
 * 1. Create a URLTranslation object with urltrans_create.
 * 2. Add translations into it with urltrans_add_one or urltrans_add_cfg.
 * 3. Receive SMS messages, and translate them into URLs with 
 *    urltrans_get_url.
 * 4. When you are done, free the object with urltrans_destroy.
 *
 * See below for more detailed instructions for using the functions.
