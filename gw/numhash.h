 * numhash.h - (telephone) number storing/hashing system
 *
 * Kalle Marjola 2000 for project Kannel
 *
 * !!! NOTE NOTE NOTE !!!
 *
 * Phone number precision is limited according to sizeof(long long)
 * in host machine. that is usually either 32 or 64 bits. In a
 * case of 32 bit longs, only last 19 digits are checked, otherwise
 * last 38 digits. This means that in some places several numbers
 * might map to same hash entry, and thus some caution is needed
 * specially with telephone number black lists
 *
 * USAGE:
 *  the system is not very dynamic; if you want to resize the table
 *  or hash, you must first nuke all old data and then recreate it
 *
 * MEMORY NEEDED:  (approximated)
 *
 * 2* (sizeof(long long)+sizeof(void *)) bytes per number
