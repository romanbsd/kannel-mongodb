 *Compile PAP control document to a corresponding Kannel event. Checks vali-

 * Note that entities in the DTD are parameter entities and they can appear

 * Returns 0, when success

 *        -2, when error
 * In addition, returns a newly created wap event corresponding the pap 
 * control message, if success, wap event NULL otherwise.
