 * the following: 
 *   wml_text: the WML text to be compiled
 *   charset: the character set as HTTP headers declare it
 *   wml_binary: buffer for the compiled WML binary
 *   version: max wbxml version supported by device, or NULL for default
 *
 * The wml_text and charset are allocated by the caller and should also be
 * freed by the caller. The function takes care for memory allocation for
 * the wml_binary. The caller is responsible for freeing this space. 
 * 
 * Return: 0 for ok, -1 for an error
 * 
 * Errors are logged with a little explanation and error number.
