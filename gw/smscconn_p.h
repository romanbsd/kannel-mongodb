 ADDING AND WORKING OF NEW SMS CENTER CONNECTIONS:

 These are guidelines and rules for adding new SMSC Connections to
 Kannel. See file bb_smscconn_cb.h for callback function prototypes.

 An SMSC Connection handler is free-formed module which only has the following
 rules:

 1) Each new SMSC Connection MUST implement function
    smsc_xxx_create(SMSCConn *conn, CfgGrp *cfg), which:

    a) SHOULD NOT block   (XXX)
    b) MUST warn about any configuration group variables it does
       not support    (XXX)
    c) MUST set up send_msg dynamic function to handle messages
       to-be-sent. This function MAY NOT block. This function MAY
       NOT destroy or alter the supplied message, but instead copy
       it if need to be stored
    d) CAN set up private shutdown function, which MAY NOT block
    e) SHOULD set private function to return number of queued messages
       to-be-sent inside the driver
    f) MUST set SMSCConn->name

 2) Each SMSC Connection MUST call certain BB callback functions when
    certain things occur:

    a) Each SMSC Connection MUST call callback function
       bb_smscconn_killed when it dies because it was put down earlier
       with bb_smscconn_shutdown or it simply cannot keep the connection
       up (wrong password etc. When killed,
       SMSC Connection MUST release all memory it has taken EXCEPT for
       the basic SMSCConn struct, which is laterwards released by the
       bearerbox.

    b) When SMSC Connection receives a message from SMSC, it must
       create a new Msg from it and call bb_smscconn_received

    c) When SMSC Connection has sent a message to SMSC, it MUST call
       callback function bb_smscconn_sent. The msg-parameter must be
       identical to msg supplied with smscconn_send, but it can be
       a duplicate of it

    d) When SMSC Connection has failed to send a message to SMSC, it
       MUST call callback function bb_smscconn_send_failed with appropriate
       reason. The message supplied as with bb_smscconn_send

    e) When SMSC Connection changes to SMSCCONN_ACTIVE, connection MUST
       call bb_smscconn_connected

 3) SMSC Connection MUST fill up SMSCConn structure as needed to, and is
    responsible for any concurrency timings. SMSCConn->status MAY NOT be
    set to SMSCCONN_DEAD until the connection is really that.
    Use why_killed to make internally dead, supplied with reason.

    If the connection is disconnected temporarily, the connection SHOULD
    call bb_smscconn_send_failed for each message in its internal list

 4) When SMSC Connection shuts down (shutdown called), it MUST try to send
    all messages so-far relied to it to be sent if 'finish_sending' is set
    to non-zero. If set to 0, it MUST call bb_smscconn_send_failed
    for each message not yet sent.

    After everything is ready (it can happen in different thread), before
    calling callback function bb_smscconn_killed it MUST release all memory it
    has taken except for basic SMSCConn structure, and set status to
    SMSCCONN_DEAD so it can be finally deleted.

 5) Callback bb_smscconn_ready is automatically called by main
    smscconn_create. New implementation MAY NOT call it directly

 6) SMSC Connection driver must obey is_stopped/stopped variable to
    suspend receiving (it can still send/re-connect), or must set
    appropriate function calls. When connection is stopped, it is not
    allowed to receive any new messages
