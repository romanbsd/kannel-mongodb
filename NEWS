http://bugs.kannel.org/ or send a mail to <devel@kannel.org> (the development 
mailing list).


Changes since version 1.5.0 devel: 

[*** Beware that the version move from 1.5.0 devel to 1.4.4 stable contains 
numerous change sets, with major bug fixes and improvements. Following is a 
summary of the main issues. For a complete and detailed set of changes please 
refer to the specific ChangeLog in the doc/ directory of the distribution. ***]

Compatibility breakers:

  * SMPP config directives can have ONLY ONE session, either config directive
    'port' or 'receive-port' can be set to identify if this is a bind as
    transmitter or receiver. Configurations with both config directives will
    PANIC at startup time.

New features:

  * Added DLR support for redis.
  
  * Added DLR support for spool directories.
  
  * Added DLR support for SQLite3.
    
  * Added SMSC support for GSMA OneAPI/Ericsson ParlayX via gSOAP.
   
  * Added SMSC SMPP support for optional TLVs of response PDUs via meta-data.
  
  * Added 'dead-start' feature for SMSC groups.
  
  * Added SMSC HTTP generic support for meta-data.
  
  * Added smsbox support to listen to specific interfaces.

Bugfixes:

  * Fixed smsbox HTTP call starvation while retrying.
  
  * Fixed various minor memory leaks for smsbox reported by valgrind.
  
  * Converted various PANIC conditions to WARNING/ERROR conditions to keep
    the operations running.
    
  * Fixed various issues with DLR handling.
  
  * Fixed various segmentation fault possibilities.
  
  * Fixed various internal character transcoding issues.
  
  * Fixed issues for smsbox shutdown.

  * Fixed bearerbox MO routing logic.


Changes since version 1.4.3: 

[*** Beware that the version move from 1.4.3 to 1.5.0 contains numerous 
change sets, with major bug fixes and improvements. Following is a summary of the 
main issues. For a complete and detailed set of changes please refer to the 
specific ChangeLog in the doc/ directory of the distribution. ***]

Compatibility breakers:

  * Internal message structure has changed, so older smsbox connection daemons
    won't be able to communicate with this bearerbox. Please ensure that you
    use boxes from releases greater or equal 1.5.0 for correct communication.
    
  * DLR storage via MySQL requires now MySQL 4.1 or higher, due that we use now
    prepared statements in the SQL calls.

New features:

  * Added 'meta-data' support, which provides a mechanism to pass SMSC protocol
    specific optional data to the lower SMSC module layer. Ie. optional TLVs 
    for SMPP.
    
  * Added better serial speed support for the AT modem on MacOS systems.
  
  * Added cleaner iconv() support for character re-encoding.
  
  * Added SMPP v3.4 DLR support via optional TLV values.
  
  * Added DLR support for the MT batch processing program.
  
  * Added Microsoft SQL server support as DLR storage backend.
  
  * Extended the HTTP admin interface.
  
  * Added SMPP v3.4 intermediate notification support.
  
  * Added MT module handling of +CME ERROR cases.
  
  * Added better result parsing generic HTTP SMSC module.
  
  * Added better throughput handling in SMPP module.
  
  * Added SMSC module 'loopback' as the MT counterpart of the 're-route'
    directive in the 'group = smsc' for MO messages. MT messages are 
    bounced back as MOs into the incoming queue.
    
  * Added separate DLR message counters on the HTTP admin status.
  
  * Added 'http-timeout' config directive to allow setting of a timeout
    value for outgoing HTTP calls.
  
  * Added WTLS provisioning support.
  
  * Added add-on packages sqlbox and opensmppbox to the main distribution,
    where sqlbox provides abstraction from bearerbox towards SQL RDBMS and
    opensmppbox provides abstraction from bearerbox towards SMPP clients. 
   
Bugfixes:

  * Fixed various bugs in AT module.
  
  * Fixed various memory leaks.
  
  * Fixed ISO date parsing.
  
  * Fixed HTTP cookie parsing in WAP module.
  
  * Fixed WAP-WSP quoted text parsing.
 
  * Fixed various WAP module bugs.
  
  * Fixed MT batch processing program.

  * Fixed FreeBSD build procedure.
  
  * Fixed OMA OTA compiler output.
  
  * Fixed weak DLR resolving for some SMSC types.


Changes since version 1.4.1: 

[*** Beware that the version move from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2 contains numerous 
change sets, with major bug fixes and improvements. Following is a summary of the 
main issues. For a complete and detailed set of changes please refer to the 
specific ChangeLog in the doc/ directory of the distribution. ***]

Compatibility breakers:

  * Internal message payload encoding changed from LATIN1 to UTF-8, which 
    means any 1.4.2 boxes are unable to communicate with older versions.
  
  * Re-defined logic for the 'smsbox-route' group that is used for MO 
    routing to different (identified) smsbox connections. 
  
  * Changed main message structure to include foreign (SMSC) ID to it, 
    breaking the access-log format and communication to older box versions.

New features:

  * Added service routing based on account field, which allows routing of
    MO messages depending on the account set by an aggregating SMSC provider.
  
  * Added the new 'generic' system-type for HTTP SMSC, which allows the usage
    of the escape code sequenced in send-url and regex parsing of HTTP
    response.
    
  * Added 'interactive' mode via stdin and stdout to allow a more human like 
    interaction with the fake smsc module.
    
  * Added support to pass the 'from' source addr via 'X-Kannel-From' HTTP 
    header in the PPG request.
    
  * Added generic DLR handling for type 'kannel' (HTTP SMSC), which allows 
    point-to-point DLR forwarding though the whole kannel instance chain. 

  * Added support for store spool directory.

  * Added concatenation MO support.
  
  * Added AT SMSC support for protocol 'type = telnet', which interprets telnet
    escape sequenced compared to rawtcp.

    the '[white|black]-list' on the fly. 
  
  * Added support of concatenated, 8bit and Unicode messages over HTTP via 
    Clickatell.
     
Bugfixes:

  * Fixed alias support for sms-service in smsbox scope.

  * Fixed various MIME type handling bugs.

  * Fixed security and race condition issue in HTTP module for keep-alive 
    connections.

  * Fixed wrong length calculation for concatenated messages.
  
  * Fixed bug that AT SMSC put UDH without UDH len.
  
  * Fixed various memleaks, reported by valgrind.
  
  * Fixed HTTP proxy scheme interpretation for SSL-enabled connections.

  * Fixed OTA compiler, within WBXML compilation.
  
  * Fixed encoding of 'Content-Id' WSP header.

  * Fixed various segfaults in SMPP, logging modules.
  
  * Fixed various AT command handling in AT module.

  * Fixed 7bit encoding in AT SMSC.
  

Changes since version 1.4.0: 

[*** Beware that the version move from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 contains more then 200 
change sets, with major bug fixes and improvements. Following is a summary of the 
main issues. For a complete and detailed set of changes please refer to the 
specific ChangeLog in the doc/ directory of the distribution. ***]

Compatibility breakers:

  * Format for wapbox's access-log format changed to include the MSISDN of
    a client as second argument after client IP and before method.

  * fakesmsc uses now -r to specify the remote port on bearerbox side. Option
    -p is generally reserved for pid file creation.

  * sendsms now obeys bearerbox's reply before indicating result to HTTP 
    caller. This breaks any application layer clients that rely on the HTTP
    body response of sendsms. To enforce the old behaviour use config
    directive 'immediate-sendsms-reply = true' in smsbox group.
    
  * DLR via MySQL uses now also 'username' and 'password' for the 
    mysql-connection group in order to harmonize the config names.

New features:

  * Added config directive 'store-dump-freq' to core group to define the
    fequency of the store-file dumping mechanism.
    
  * Added backtrace support for Linux. In case of PANIC, we get a backtrace
    of the called routines to make debugging easier.
    
  * Added some new modem groups to doc/examples/modems.conf.
  
  * Added more WTAI functions to support.
  
  * Added RAW TCP support for remote termnial servers for AT modem devices.
  
  * Added 'config.nice' support while configure time, to allow "remembering" 
    the used configure flags and options.
    
  * Added OMA ProvCont support via OTA messages.
  
  * Added SyncML support via OTA messages.
  
  * Added directive 'wml-strict' to wapbox group. 
  
  * SMPP data_sm PDUs are supported now for MO messages.
  
  * SMPP added config directives 'bind-addr-ton' and 'bind-addr-npi' to allow
    setting values for bind_receiver and/or bind_transmitter PDUs.
  
  * Added support for WSP 1.6 headers.

  * Added automatic support for large files, via compiler directives.      

  * Added config line delimiter via \ (backslash). This allows wrapping config
    lines to several lines.
 
  * Added support for hooking config group definition files as our own 
    gwlib/cfg.def from external add-on modules to the core. Main intention is 
    to provide a installed Kannel without the need of patching the source for
    any modules that use Kannel's gwlib and gw libs.
    
  * Added config directives 'bearerbox-port' and 'bearerbox-port-ssl' to 
    smsbox group, in order to not need any core group reading of external
    modules, ie. sqlbox.

  * Added config directive 'max-pending-requests' for smsbox group to control 
    the outbound requests stream generated from smsbox towards HTTP 
    application servers.

Bugfixes:

  * Fixed several bugs in TCP connection handling.
  
  * Fixed several bugs in HTTP communication layer.
  
  * Fixed segfaults on x86_64 (Intel Xeon) platforms.
  
  * SMPP validity and defer time are set in UTC, several improvements and 
    error checks added.
  
  * Fixed several 'make check' issues.
  
  * MySQL support fixed, where certain function prototype names clashed
    with our own gwlist structure.
    
  * DLR support for PostgreSQL fixed for LIMIT clause usage.

  * WSP empty header values fixed.

  * WDP fix to discard truncated datagrams without PANIC.
  
  * WAP Cookie handling fixed, charset handling generalized.
  
  * AT driver fixes and improvements.
  
  * RADIUS bug fixed in MD5 computing for authentication towards NAS.

  * MacOS X support improved for configure process.
  
  * store-file fixes and improvements.
  
  * WML compiler fix, causing sefault.
  
  * Fixed memory leaks for concat message handling.
  
  * MIME parsing and handling fixed.
  
  * FreeBSD AMD64 architecture support fixed.
  
  * Fixed wapbox signal handling for shutdown.
  
  * WTP SAR race condition and handling fixed.
  
  * Fixed memory leaks in smsbox.
  
  * sendsms POST XML handling fixed, where sender address was not parsed.
  
  * smsbox reply handling fixed, to copy the originating smsc-id value
    in the reply messages.


Changes since version 1.3.2: 

Compatibility breakers:

  * fakesmsc switching from -p to -r for port, since -p is used for pid-file 
    creation. This broke fakesmsc to use an other port then the default 10000 
    to connect to the smsc_fake module of bearerbox.

New features:

  * Added ability to start/stop/restart of all smscconn's that have equal 
    smsc-id's instead of only one.

  * Implemented very simple priority queue ala Robert Sedgewick for gwlib. 

  * Implemented concatenation of large sms inside bearerbox and does care of 
    sending all message parts over one smsc link. Now we have a problem with 
    concatenated large sms that bearerbox will try to load balance those over 
    different smsc links and such messages arrive as junk (all parts of 
    concatenated large sms must go through the same smsc).

  * SMPP added ESME dlr bit to DLR processing, added setting of sms priority 
    flag in smsbox and smpp module. 
    
  * bruNET upgrading response parsing to comply with more recent interface 
    version (v2.0+) where bruNET delivers 'MessageId' in the HTTP response 
    body.
    
  * AT, EMI usage of the of priority queue and priority flag.

  * URLTranslation added '%o' as escape code for MO msgs representing the 
    msg->sms.account field. Which is interpreted as the operator ID for 
    aggregator specific MO messages. ie. Xidris HTTP SMSC module.
    
  * test_ppg added support for X-WAP-Initiator-URI, use -I option.

Bugfixes:

  * SMPP fixed panic on NULLed source_addr/destination_addr, for nulterminated 
    string length checking of PDU elements, bug that dlr lookup was made with 
    source instead of destination address (in dlr source and destination 
    switched), fixed incorrect handling of GSM_ADDR_TON_ALPHANUMERIC for 
    destination address,
    
  * AT fixed segfault when modemtype is set to 'auto' or 'autodetect', 
    fixed '+CPIN', some modem needs '"'.

  * HTTP fixed a binary MT bug (when DC_8BIT has been set) and various 
    improvements for passing parameters to the HTTP request, fixing 3united 
    (formerly Xidris) HTTP interface for  binary MT messages. We passed 
    URL-encoded binary string, but server side  expected HEX encoded (2 char
    per byte) version.
    
  * WSP string coding bug fixed.

  * WML compiler fixed panic for certain DOCTYPE definitions, memory leak fixed. 

  * XMLRPC fixed memory leak.

  * Fixed ISO date handling.

  * Fixed double encoding in smsbox when trans coding from UCS2 to UTF-8 or 
    ISO-8859-1.

  * Improved pthread reader/writer-locks.

  * Fixed usage of native semaphores on MacOS X to avoid a "not implemented" 
    error.

  * Fixed pthread lib settings for FreeBSD 5.2.1. 
  
  * Added check for 'sem_init' in librt. This needs on Solaris & HP-UX.

  * Fixed Linux version of gw_gethostbyname when gethostbyname_r failed. 
    Also free buffer on error.

  * Fixed daemon mode (make sure stdin/stdout/sdterr are opened and do 
    chdir("/")) and change user code (set supplementary group id's and 
    don't destroy passwd struct).

  * Bug work-around causing segfault on cygwin while using uninited 
    rwlock functions.

  * Various memory leak and double free fixes.


Changes since version 1.3.1: 

[*** Beware that the version move from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2 contains more then 400 
changesets, with major bugfixes and improvemnts. Following is a summary of the 
main issues. For a complete and detailed set of changes please refer to the 
specific ChangeLog in the doc/ directory of the distribution. ***]

Compatibility breakers:

  * LICENSE changed to Kannel Software License v1.0. BSD-style as before with 
    some more restrictions to the name "Kannel" and usage of it.
 
  * SMPP changed recoding of source_addr and destination_addr on the MO side. 
    We will pass a prefixed '+' to the smsbox side. Otherwise there is no 
    chance for backend applicatins, like smsbox to decide what type of number 
    it is. 

  * EMI2 login operation 60 had a hard timeout of 30 sec. Some SMSC may need 
    longer to ACK the login, so use the 'wait-ack' time value here too in case 
    it's larger then 30 sec. 

  * CIMD2 harmonized 'my-number' directive, this makes 'sender-prefix' 
    absolete, interpretation of 'keepalive' is now in seconds instead of 
    minutes. 

  * HTTP SMSC changed 'dlrurl' to 'dlr-url', 'dlrmask' to 'dlr-mask' in order 
    to reflect changes within smsbox's sendsms interface.
 
  * Removed no more needed 'retry' smsc group directive. This is now handled 
    via the more abstracted 'reconnect-delay' value. 

  * WAP access.log file of wapbox has now some more elements, ie. remote IP of
    client, HTTP method, length of content body, user agent string, HTTP 
    server string, cookie support is enabled now by default, added new 
    'wap-url-map' and 'wap-user-map groups to replace deprecated 'map-url' map.

  * Renamed internal SMSC module identifiers for the smsc group directive 
    'smsc', which identifies which SMSC module is to be used for the specific
    link, according to these: <emi2> to <emi>, <at2> to <at>, <emi> to 
    <emi_x25>. 

  * The configure option switch --with-defaults default value is now "speed". 

  * (!!!) smsbox's sendsms interface changed for values passed to various 
    variables, according to this: pid=0 says that you want a pid value in pdu, 
    with value 0; mclass is now 0-3; coding is 0-2; alt-dcs is 0-1; mwi is 0-7 
    to comply with ETSI values; dlrmask and dlrurl query parameters are 
    deprecated, but still functional; please use dlr-mask and dlr-url; flash 
    was removed.
 
  * Changed core group config option 'maximum-queue-length' to 
    'sms-incoming-queue-limit' for the sake of semantics.

  * Added 'binfo' billing identifier/information element to bearerbox's 
    access.log log format.

  * Changed the way how DLR storage is "defined" while configure time, according
    to this: removes '--with-dlr', --with-mysql to --with-mysql-dir,
    --enable-[mysql|oracle|sdb|sqlite] to --with-[mysql|oracle|sdb|sqlite].
 
  * Account field is required in DLR tablespace and dlr config sections too.

New features:

  * SMPP added facility to specify SMSC service type with 
    'service-type = foo', adding handling of invaid userid and/or passwd to  
    shutdown SMSC connection rather than retrying to reconnect, a set of 
    optional parameters (SMPP v3.4) have been added, UDH support for MOs,
    handling of intermediately delivery notifications, added 'message_payload' 
    handling, added enhanced DLR parsing and handling of DLR's optional
    parameters, added "more messages to send" support.

  * EMI added XSer $0c and $0d handling, OP/31 handling for the sake of EMI
    implementations that use this construct as server-side initiated keep-alive
    mechanism.

  * CIMD2 has been rewriten to the new SMSCConn API layer, added additional 
    support features 'our-host', 'our-port' and parameter 069 (service center 
    address), harmonized log message formating, new 'no-dlr' config directive 
    to indicate if DLR requests should be proceeded, added RPI 
    (return-path-indication) support and binfo support via tariff class, allows
    setting PID for MT messages, adds "more messages to send" support.

  * HTTP SMSC added 'system-type = brunet' for an implemenation of bruNET's
    specific HTTP interface (bruHTP 2.1), harmonized debug output, added 
    'system-type = xidris' for an implementation of Xidris, 'dlrurl' and 
    'dlrmask' handling for Kannel message proxying, added 'system-type = wapme'
    for the Wapme SMS Proxy gateway interface.

  * SOAP/XML over HTTP module added. Yet not bound to abstraction layer. Hence
    this is yet experimental.

  * FAKE added DLR handling for fake smsc type. Now you can test DLR handling 
    even while unattached to real SMSC.

  * AT added +CMTI support for MO messages, 2 new config options 
    'max-error-count' and 'reset-string' for hard reset of the modem when modem 
    crashes.
    
  * OISD has been rewriten to SMSCConn API, added validity support.
    
  * HTTP admin command 'restart' added to restart bearerbox, 'loglevel' to  
    change log-level of log-files while bearerbox is running.

  * Added 'our-host' interface support for binding to an explicit interface 
    on SMSC connections. 

  * Added smsc specific logging capability by handling open log files in 
    exclusive or non-explusive mode, using 'log-file' and 'log-level' as smsc 
    config directives. 

  * Added --disable-wap and --disable-sms configure switches to disable parts 
    in bearerbox. 

  * Moved smsc group config directive 'reconnect-delay' into higher abstraction 
    layer to provide this for all SMSC modules. Reconnect delay is defaulting 
    to 10 sec.
 
  * Added internal restarting msg command among boxes.

  * Added new command line option ("-g" or "--generate") to bearerbox. This 
    option just dumps all known config groups and options to stdout. 

  * WAP added support for EFI inside WMLScript, added new application ids from 
    OMNA web page, WSP encoding-version handling, logging of upstream HTTP server 
    failures with HTTP response code 502 (bad gateway), new config option 
    'http-interface-name' to wapbox configuration and allow selecting of interface 
    for outgoing HTTP requests, allows to put semicolon-separated list of IP 
    addresses in 'wdp-interfaces' statement in config file and kannel send 
    responses from proper addresses.

  * WAP Push added missing official WINA URIs, 'concatenation' and 
    'max-messages' config directive support for wapbox group, handling of PPG 
    related DLR reports. PPG sends SMS with DLR, but smsbox has to do the DLR 
    signalization to the specified DLR-URL. The stored service name is read 
    from PPG core group, added 'default-dlr-url', 'ppg-smsbox-id', 
    'service-name' to ppg core group and 'dlr-url', 'smsbox-id' to 
    wap-push-user group. 
    
  * RADIUS accounting proxy implemenation added for MSISDN provisioning within
    WAP operations. 

  * Added 'throughput' smsc group config directive for MT message per sec. 
    limitation.

  * Added bearerbox internal re-routing via config directives 'reroute', 
    'reroute-smsc-id' and 'reroute-receiver' to multi-group 'smsc'. This allows
    MOs to be directly turned into MTs within bearerbox.

  * ORACLE 8i/9i support added for database polls and DLR handling.
  
  * PostgrSQL support added for database polls.
  
  * SQLITE added SQLite support for database polls. 
  
  * Added new escape code '%I' for URL translations to allow inclusion of the 
    internal SMS ID into the processing, new escape code '%T' for sending the 
    UNIX epoch timestamp in favor of '%t'.

  * Added shell script 'gw-config' to allow 3rd party software to check for
    CFLAGS, LIBS and version of the installed Kannel instance.

  * Added 'binfo' to smsbox's sendsms interface to pass relevant billing 
    identifier/information to smsc modules.

  * Added POSIX regular expression support.
  
  * Added Perl compatible regular expression (PCRE) library support via 
    --enable-pcre configure option.  

  * Added backtrace support for specific architectures for better debugging
    information on panics. Hint: use address within [] with addr2line or 
    add -rdynamic to CFLAGS. 

  * Added new config directives 'access-log-clean' and 'access-log-format' to
    allow custom core access.log formatting, 'access-log-time' to indicate if
    localtime or gmt should be used within access.log.

  * Added new command line parameters for daemons (all boxes): 
      -P/--parachute : start watcher father process that catch and restart  
	                   crashed child process 
      -X/--panic-script : execute this script if child process crashed 
	  -u/--user : change process user-id (security) 
	  -p/--pid-file : write PID into the given file 
	  -d/--daemonize : daemonize the process 

  * Added new config directive 'smsbox-max-pending'.

Bugfixes:
  
  * SM/ASI fixed TON and NPI values, PDU decoding, decoding of binary MOs, 
    enquire link pdu's were not sent within regular timeframe. 

  * SMPP fixed generic_nack definition, sequence incrementation, charset 
    encoding misbehaviour when msgs get split into multiple sms chunks, 
    checking of esm_class for DLRs (only bits 2-5), PDU decoding bug for UDH
    sequence, wrong esm_class checking for deliver_sm PDU, improved error
    handling for wrong MO PDUs, shutdown sequence improvements, bug for 
    re-encoding character set, bug that source-autodetect was 'false' if not
    defined in the config although userguide mentioned 'true', race conditions 
    amonst status and connect_time while set in various threads, optional 
    parameters handling improved.
    
  * CIMD2 fixed for CPU load consume while idle, wrong time for messages, wrong 
    parameter length for "service description" field.   

  * AT fixed panic if UDHI in PDU is set but user data length = 0, bug in
    non-blocking write to modem device, few race conditions.
    
  * HTTP SMSC fixed a number of bugs. Including bearerbox crash if smsc-id is 
    stopped and /status page is called, don't 'fail' a MT message when the HTTP 
    server can not be triggered, instead use 'reconnect-delay' to try again,
    expected MO parameters to 'username' and 'password' instead of 'user' and 
    'pass'.

  * SSL fixed a serious pthread_mutex bug for call-back function to the 
    openssl thread locking, non-blocking write mode, memory leak in SSL
    handshake sequence, various improvements. 

  * Fixed generic alt_dcs re-coding misbehaviour.

  * HTTP fixed basic auth problem with the passwd, redirecting, serious bug 
    in the HTTP client code causing smsbox to crash if the connection is 
    closed directly by the HTTP server.
  
  * Fixed bearerbox behaviour while receiving SIGHUP (restart) signal, signal 
    handling that may have caused deadlock. 

  * Fixed ACK/NACK handling beween bearerbox and smsbox.

  * WAP fixed and improved XML charset encoding handling, WSP header 
    'Encoding-Version' handling, HTTP referer header removed due to breaking 
    specific WAP Forum certification tests, various fixes in WML compiler 
    character encoding handling, DOS bug within WML compiler, possible 
    segfault if WML document doesn't contain DTD section, crashing wapbox
    while comparing empty cookie strings, various memory leaks, WTP bug for 
    abort PDU in speficic timeout events, fixed variable substitution within
    WML compiler.

  * WAP Push fixed malformed xml reponses for the PAP document, none accepted 
    <pap> attribute 'product-name', case insesitive handling of constants 
    "WAPPUSH" and "TYPE" for sake of interopertibility with existing PIs, 
    handling of Push flag, PPG specifier and prologue parsing to support other 
    PIs, including delimiter parsing, PAP MIME parsing, various memory leaks.

  * Fixed bug in smsbox that crashed if %A is used in get-url.
                                                  

Changes since version 1.3.0:

Compatibility breakers:

  * SMPP changed default behaviour of the 'source-addr-autodetect' to yes.
    Now the module will try to set TON and NPI automatically by scanning the
    given source adddress.

  * Added proxying of the smsc-id value to attached smsbox instances via 
    the HTTP SMSC module. This allows spreading load from one smsbox
    to several bearerbox instances.

New features:

  * Additional debian packaging files.

  * Documentation section about log file rotation.

  * PPG now allows routing to explicite smsc-id's. New config directives
    'default-smsc' for ppg group and 'forced-smsc' and 'default-smsc' for
    wap-push-user group have been added.

  * Added debug info about ammount of outstanding HTTP reqeusts in 
    the smsbox retry queue.

  * OIS added direct module.
  
  * CIMD2 added validity setting.

Bugfixes:

  * CIMD2 various fixes for correct urltrans()ing.

  * AT2 fixed double-increment bug for outgoing messages counter.

  * Fixed a keep-alive lookup problem when using a HTTP proxy.

  * HTTP SMSC various fixes.

  * Fixed infinite loop bug if /TYPE=xxx is missing in the PAP document.

  * Fixed a bug in the smsbox routing behaviour of bearerbox. 

  * SMPP various fixes for the optional fields decoding.

  * EMI2 fixed MO counter bug and assignmend of non-existing fields bug.

  * Various fixes in the WAP application layer.


Changes since version 1.2.1:

Compatibility breakers:

  * Added initial SMPP v3.4 optional fields support. Still very experimental.
    Use the 'interface-version = 33' config directive if you don't want to
    rely on this new code.

  * HTTP servers can bind to specific interfaces now.

  * WTP timer frequence can be set now manually with 'timer-freq' value.

  * EMI2 handling of un-acked msg can be configured via 'wait-ack-expire'
    directive. See User Guide for more details.

New features:

  * WTP-SAR (segmentation and re-assembly) is now available for the 
    WAP gateway part. This enables Kannel to function as MMS proxy.
    This has been tested with several new MMS capable phones.

  * smsbox inbound routing has been added. It allows routing based upon 
    smsc-id or receiver number rules to specific smsbox instances. This may 
    be several real smsboxes or even own boxes that act to bearerbox as if 
    they are smsboxes by using the same message communication interface. This 
    is useful for implementing own boxes that act as EMI/UCP or SMPP proxies.

  * iconv support has been added for character encoding. Adds 'alt-charset' 
    directive for the SMPP smsc group. Use iconv's type representation to 
    define which charset is used by a specific smsc.

  * HTTP connections are now established in non-blocking mode.

  * Added speed 115200 for AT2 connections if system supports.

  * Protection against malformed PDUs for AT2 has been increased.

  * Added detection of invalid TP-OA address length and logging for AT2.

  * Added National Replacement Codes (NCR) ISO 21 German for german umlauts 
    to be used with 'alt-charset' directive.

  * Added Siemens SL45 init strings for AT2.

  * Added a WAP packet proxy application, test/wapproxy.c. This may be used
    to act as a WDP, WTP proxy between WAP client and WAP gateway for 
    packet analyzation purposes.

  * Allows returning to the 'device-home' URL if 'smart-errors' are activated.
    This can be used to let the phone go back to a pre-defined URL in case an
    serious error happens, i.e. HTTP lookup of an URI fails.
  
Bugfixes:

  * SMPP thread handling bug fixed.

  * AT2 date encoding bug fixed.

  * HTTP basic auth userid and password handling bug fixed. 

  * Fixed WAP smart-error message bug, when HTTP lookup failed.

  * AT2 init string in Siemens TC35 configuration fixed.

  * Fixed various SSL connection related bugs.

  * DLR race condition due to unlocked list fixed.

  * Fixed memory leak in smsc abstraction layer for restarting smscs.

  * Fixed initial approach for client SDU size to solve the problem with 
    concatenated WSP requests.

  * SMPP throttling problem fixed.

  * Fixed HTTP queueing bug.

  * Various improvements and fixes in the HTTP routine library.

  * Fixed panics for /store-status calls if no store-file is used.
  
  * Fixed difftime calculation to make heartbeat work again.

  * Fixed possible race condition in store file saving.

Development news:

  * We need to think about and rewrite the iconv() character encoding layer.
    The character encoding should be done in the smsc module abstracted
    layer and not in the smsc specific module layer. As a base encoding we
    are going to use latin1.
         

Changes since version 1.2.0:

Compatibility breakers:

  * SMPP module users should note that the 'msg-id-type' default behaviour
    has changed. The SMPP spec says that msg ids should be C strings and
    hence we treat them as such per default. If your SMSC gives msg ids
    in submit_sm and deliver_dm PDUs in different numbering basing, then
    please use the 'msg-id-type' config directive to set it accordingly.

New features:

  * SMPP priority flag is now supported.

  * SMPP unbind PDU handling added.

  * SMPP throttling error code support added.

  * MacOS X support has been improved.

  * Added 'allowed-receiver-prefix' and 'denied-receiver-prefix' for 
    sms-service groups. This is used to restrict access to service requests 
    coming in on certain receiver numbers, i.e. shortcut numbers.
  
  * Added directives 'http-request-retry' and 'http-queue-delay' for HTTP
    request queueing for sms-service 'get-url' and 'post-url' services.
    This way a non reachable HTTP server will not cause to drop the request.
    Instead smsbox will hold a queue and retry the HTTP request via the 
    configurable settings 'http-request-retry' and 'http-queue-delay'.

  * Added 'store-status' HTTP admin command to retrieve the messages 
    currently in the main queue.

  * Added a '--with-cflags=CFLAGS' and '--with-libs=LIBS' configuration
    options. These are useful when Kannel is linked against additional
    proprietary modules.

  * Improvements in the Siemens M20 GSM modem support.
 
  * Added EMI2 specific configuration directives 'notification-pid' and 
    'notification-addr'. 

  * Added Return Path Indicator (RPI) support for SMPP and EMI2 via boolean 
    sendsms interface parameter 'rpi'

  * LibSDB support for external storage has been added. libSDB is an abstraction
    library for various DB system, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, gdbm 
    and some others.

  * wapbox has an own access.log facility now.

  * Added the new 'smasi' SMSC type for connecting to SM/ASI protocol SMSC, 
    like the CriticalPath InVoke SMS Center.

  * Added HEAD method support for HTTP client module.

  * DLR support for the AT2 module has been added.

  * Slight re-organization of the DLR module to make it easier in supporting 
    other SMSC modules too.

  * Added 'unified-prefix' configuration directive on a smsc basis to set 
    number normalization rules. This may be used it SMSC connections handle 
    prefix normalization differently.

  * Added 'source-addr-autodetect' to smsc group for auto-detecting source 
    addr in smpp module, if desired.
  
Bugfixes:

  * Timezone issue fixed in SMPP module.
 
  * Output of fakewap has been made more human-readable.

  * Various fixes and improments in the wmlscript parsing routines.

  * Fixed various other possible segmentation faulting bugs in handling
    null'ed Octstr vars.

  * Fixed various mutex problems that caused errors while accessing lists.

  * Some fixes in HTTP keep-alive handling logic that causes our client to 
    keep the connection up, even while the server has asked to drop it.

  * Various fixes and improvements in the PPG (push proxy gateway) module.

  * Fixed a bug in the prefix-match routine that caused to tread an number
    match not to be a prefix match.


Changes since version 1.1.6:

Compatibility breakers:

 * configure now uses the --enable-localtime as default. This will log
   file stamps in local time, not GMT. Beware if you need other timezone 
   date logging to switch this off.

 * configure now uses the --with-malloc=native as default. This is more
   suitable for production environments then the limited malloc checking
   counterpart.

 * Use the 'to' HTTP GET variable to specify the destination MSISDN of 
   outbound messages for both sendsms and sendota HTTP interfaces.

 * wapbox does not any longer start a PPG HTTP server thread if no ppg
   group is specified in the configuration file.

New features:

 * Harmonized logging output for EMI2 and SMPP module.

 * Added on-the-fly shutdown and re-start for specific smsc-ids via the
   administrative HTTP interface URIs 'stop-smsc' and 'start-smsc'.

 * Added traffic statistics of inbound and output SMS on the status page.

 * Added 'interface-version' config directive for SMPP module.

 * Added timing configuration directives for SMPP module to specify 
   reconnect delays and timeout values.

 * Added alternative DCS support for SMPP module to define alternative DCS
   value via sendsms's alt-dcs flag.

 * Added support for XML POSTs of SMS messages on the basis of the IETF
   draft http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-koponen-sms-xml-03.txt.

 * Added transceiver mode for SMPP links.

 * Added wapbox directive 'smart-errors' for smarter WSP error messages to
   the handset device.

 * Added wapbox directive 'force-sar' for forced processing of segmentation
   and reassembly (WTP-SAR) packages.

Bugfixes:

 * Fixed compiler warning for gcc 3.x for compiler macros.

 * Fixed a couple of memory leaks in various modules.

 * Improved the output of the status page and fixed the status condition
   if an SMPP link is only used as receiver.

 * Fixed validity issues in the SMPP module.

 * Fixed a possible segv bug in SSL connection opening call.

 * Fixed handling of application ids in the PPG module.

 * Implemented a queue limit for outbound messages. This should hold up the
   situation that there are infinitely more messages injected to the queue
   then there are outflowing to the SMSC connections.

 * Further improvements in the AT2 module.

 * Fixed some MySQL related problems while processing DLRs to databases.


Changes since version 1.1.6:

Compatibility breakers:

 * GET method variable 'phonenumber' will be replaced by 'to' for the 
   sendota HTTP interface. Currently we run both, to allow users to 
   switch seamlessly.

New features:

 * sendota HTTP interface requests can be send in POST method mode
   containing special X-Kannel HTTP headers for the control information
   and the OTA XML document as body content.


Changes since version 1.1.5:

Compatibility breakers:

 * Major restructuring of the AT2 module has been done. 
   See the ChangeLog for more details.
 
New features:

 * PPG module has been introduced and works for both IPv4 and SMS based 
   bearers. Supported document types are SL and SI. The PPG is an essential
   item of the WAP Push architecture.

 * WTLS support has been included, but yet not finished. 
   Development in this area is still needed.

 * Flash SMS support added.
   Messages that arrive at mobile terminals are displayed directly to the
   user interface and usually they can not be saved to the inbox.

 * 3G Lab contributed the XML files for their Alligata.
 
 * Added "keepalive" feature for EMI2 module.

 * MWI (message waiting indicator) message support added.
   These messages do cause the mobile terminal to indicate special events
   on the user interface, i.e. showing that a new E-Mail has arrived.

 * AT2 now supports Siemens TC35

 * Added DLR (delivery report) support for SMSC modules.
   Delivery reports are returned by SMSCs and can trigger a defined URL in 
   order to inform the pushing application of a successful transmission of
   the message. URLs can be set on a per-message request basis and hence 
   semantics of the message ID is kept by the requesting application.

 * AT2 now support autodetection of modem devices.

 * HTTP basic authentication can be used now for sms-service groups.
   This allows SMS services to access HTTP resources that need explicit
   user authentication using the HTTP basic authentication scheme (RFC 2617).

 * EMI2 windowing control has been added.
   
 * DLRs may be stored to external storage.
   Using the --with-dlr configure flag external storage spaces may be used 
   for the DLRs. This is useful in cases you take your boxes down and 
   do not want to loose all pending DLR messages. 
   Currently MySQL is supported as external storage.
 
 * SSL-enabled HTTP servers are now available for any HTTP interface.
   Users may rely now on secured HTTPS scheme communication between HTTP
   clients and Kannel's HTTP servers. This is used for the sendsms and the
   administration HTTP interface.

 * Cygwin platform is now supported out-of-the-box without additional pthreads
   libraries from 1.3.9.

 * WAP OTA (over-the-air) has been improved.
   OTA settings and bookmarks may be send via SMS bearer to capable mobile
   terminals. Pre-defined sets from the configuration may be send or 
   individual sets using a GET request parameter. 
   This will change to allow POST of the OTA XML document.

 * Several new phones are supported for the AT2 module.
   See the doc/modems.conf file for their definitions.

 * New sendsms HTTP interface field 'account' has been introduced.
   This is mainly for accounting purposes.

 * SSL-enabled inter-box TCP communication can be used.
   In case boxes are running on different machines in different unreliable
   networks this may be used to secure the TCP connection between them, i.e.
   smsbox talking to a remote bearerbox and communication is SSL-enabled.

 * URIs for the HTTP interfaces configurable.
   The HTTP interface default URIs for the sendsms and sendota functions may 
   be defined in the configuration to individual URIs.
   
 * Added SMSC interface implementation to Sonera ContentGateway. 

 * Solaris packaging added.

 * Added 'exec' translation type to sms-service.
   This allows to execute arbitrary external code and pass the output as 
   reply to the message sender.

 * Include within configuration files added.
   This makes 'include = "foobar.conf"' possible and hence segmenting the groups
   to their own config files to make the setup more clean.

 * Improved HTTP SMSC behaviour.

 * SIM buffering for AT2 has been included.
   This is a fail-safe mechanism to handle messages that pass the regular line
   of processing to the SIM card.

Bugfixes:

 * Various fixes in all major SMSC modules.

 * Fixed bugs in text concatenation.

 * Fixed make process bug for Solaris 2.6

 * Various memory leaks have been fixed.

 * Fixed default DocBook detection for FreeBSD platform.

 * Fixed forced-smsc bug for sendota HTTP interface.

 * Fixed issues to support Linux on PowerPC and S390 again.

Development news:

 * WTLS is the next major challenge.
   At least --with-wtls=openssl configure leads to a clean make process.
   3ui's kwtls package seems to be good enough as sample for the missing
   WTLS parts.

 * Added general MySQL connection support.
   This may be extended to have several groups reside in corresponding MySQL
   tables and hence operation of highly dynamical environments gets easier, 
   because there is no need to restart or -HUP the boxes.
   

Changes since version 1.1.4:

Compatibility breakers:

 * sendsms service now uses the HTTP status code in replies, instead of
   always using 200.  Valid requests get 202 (Accepted), invalid requests
   get an error code.

New features:

 * fakewap is better at testing high loads.

 * Added sender-prefix configuration variable for CIMD2.

 * A new sms-service escape sequence, %i, which expands to the smsc-id
   of the message.

 * Added a status.xml service to the administration interface.

Bugfixes:

 * Minor bugfix to emi2.

 * Fixed handling of accept-x-kannel-headers and assume-plain-text
   configuration fields.

 * Phone-as-SMSC driver can handle text messages with UDH.

 * Fixed a rare case that could cause a deadlock between the bearerbox
   and smsbox.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented having many smsc configuration blocks.

 * HTTP: Correctly handle redirections to invalid URLs.

 * Don't panic if there is no "default" sms-service.

Development news:

 * Beginnings of https support.  Not secure yet.


Changes since version 1.1.3:

Security:

 * smsbox: X-Kannel-UDH headers in HTTP responses are no longer accepted,
   unless accept-x-kannel-headers is configured for the service.  This
   prevents possibly untrusted sites from setting strange UDH values.

 * Bugfix: An empty POST request from a client could crash the wapbox.

Compatibility breakers:

 * smsbox: HTTP responses with content-type application/octet-stream (or
   no content-type at all) will be sent as "octet data" instead of assumed
   to be text/plain.  This makes it possible to send for example ring tones
   in response to user messages.

 * smsbox: The "user" field is now required in all sendsms services.

 * Kannel now uses the same "data coding scheme" values in all SMSC
   protocols that use them.  It is now used only to set the alphabet,
   and leaves the message class alone.  This affects the Phone-as-SMSC,
   CIMD2, OIS, and SMPP modules.

 * Compiling Kannel now requires libxml 2.2.5 or later.

New features:

 * New sms-service type "posturl", which makes a POST request
   containing the message in the body and other information in X-Kannel-
   headers.  The sendsms interface also accepts POST requests in this format.
   Not documented yet.

 * Sendsms services also accept POST requests.

 * smsbox: X-Kannel-From and X-Kannel-To headers can be used in HTTP
   responses to set the sender and receiver numbers, if
   accept-x-kannel-headers is configured for the service.

 * New, improved module for UCP/EMI SMSC protocol, called "emi2".
   It will replace the emi and emi_ip modules in the future, but coexists
   with them in this release.

 * New configuration variable catch-all in sms-service configuration
   groups.  If this is set, the service will be used for all messages
   that match its keyword, instead of only messages that have the right
   number of words.  Useful for defining service-specific error replies.

 * Configuration variables such as "concatenation" can now be set to
   yes/no or true/false instead of just 0 or 1.

 * Kannel can be configured to store incoming SMS messages in a file
   until they have been processed, so that they can not be lost in a crash.

 * Improved portability to MacOS X.

 * SMPP SMSC module will send enquire_link packets at regular intervals.
   This is needed to stay connected with some SMSCs.

 * Significant improvements to the SMPP SMSC module.  It should now be
   ready for serious use.

 * Phone-as-SMSC module will retry a few times if sending a message fails.
   This works around many temporary problems.

Bugfixes:

 * Support libxml versions that install xml2-config instead of xml-config.

 * Several memory leaks fixed.

 * Fixed panic if faked-sender configuration variable is used in a sendsms
   service.

 * Sendsms replies now have no-cache headers to prevent proxies from
   trying to cache sendsms queries.

 * Some PDU encoding errors in the Phone-as-SMSC module were fixed.

 * CIMD2 SMSC module works around a bug in some SMSCs that could cause
   messages to be received multiple times.

 * HTTP module can (again) handle "100 Continue" responses from servers.

 * Lots of minor bugfixes.

Development news:

 * More work on WAP Push.

Known problems:

 * New POST-based interface for SMS is not documented.

 * The CIMD2 SMSC module can sometimes send multiple "alive" requests
   at a time, which breaks the protocol and confuses the SMSC.

 * Concatenated text messages don't work with all protocols.


Changes since version 1.1.2:


Security:

 * A bug in the error handling code would make Kannel crash if a HTTP
   request (for example to sendsms) contained literal spaces in the URL.
   This has been fixed.  The problem was not present in the 1.0 series.

New features:

 * New "http" SMSC which allows Kannel to be used with HTTP-based
   SMS interfaces (such as Kannel itself, so that you can chain them).

 * WML compiler produces slightly smaller output.

Bugfixes:

 * Phone-as-SMSC module made more reliable under high load.  In particular,
   reopening a broken connection works again.

 * Bearerbox no longer treats any UDP errors as fatal, they are just
   warnings now.

 * Several memory leaks fixed.

Development news:

 * Started a benchmarking framework, activated with "make bench".

 * Bearerbox now uses the conn module for box connections.

 * octstr_format takes a new %E format which does http-url encoding.


Changes since version 1.1.1:

Compatibility breakers:

 * Format of access log output has changed.

New features:

 * Support for Ericsson GSM modems.

 * smsbox: HTTP responses can now send UDH messages by sending an
   X-Kannel_UDH header in the reply.

 * smsbox: Added "%b" translation for receiving binary data.

 * Updated and expanded User's Guide.

 * SMPP driver now responds to Enquire Link packets, which will help
   keep Kannel connected to an SMS center when the connection is idle.

 * Small perl script to read and summarize access log output.

 * wapbox is better at dealing with HTTP responses that are too large
   for the client, or in the wrong format.

Bugfixes:

 * WMLScript compiler avoids generating zero-length functions, so that
   the result works on more clients.

 * smsbox: Numerous fixes to the message splitting functions.

 * smsbox: OTA configuration works again.

 * WML compiler: Corrected encodings for "ordered true" and "ordered false".

Development news:

 * WML decompiler improved.


Changes since version 1.1:


Compatibility breakers:

 * Kannel now complains about unknown configuration settings, rather than
   silently ignoring them.


New features:

 * The SMS testing tool (fakesmsc) has been replaced with a better one.
   It can be started and stopped while Kannel is running, which makes
   it easier to use.  It also supports udh.

 * validityperiod option for phone-as-SMSC, see user guide for details.

 * User's Guide has section on how to use pre-compiled Kannel packages.

 * Improved portability to FreeBSD.

 * Updated CIMD2 code to version "2-0 en" of the specification.


Bugfixes:

 * http-proxy-exceptions works again.

 * SMS service keywords are case-insensitive again.

 * If SMS request has unknown keyword, and no default is specified,
   reply "Request failed" instead of logging a confusing error message.

 * Fixed possible deadlock in bearerbox startup.

 * Fixed a number of memory leaks.

 * Fixed some errors that only showed up with --with-malloc=native.


Development news:

 * All boxes now use the new configuration file interface.


Changes since version 0.13.1:


Compatibility breakers:

 * Replies from the bearerbox admin interface are now formatted according
   to the Accept: headers sent by the client, preferring WML over HTML
   over plain text.  They used to always be plain text.

 * Filling in admin-password is now mandatory in the configuration file.

 * In the configuration for UCP/EMI SMSCs, username and password are
   now used if they are set, and not used if they are not.
   They used to be mandatory even though they were never used, so in
   existing configurations they are likely to contain dummy values
   that will not work.  (This was actually changed before 0.13.1, we
   forgot to note it then.)


New features:

 * New SMPP module.  Written for SMPP 3.4 but should support 3.3 as well.

 * smsbox reports load to the bearerbox.

 * Added status.wml, status.html, and status.txt commands to the bearerbox
   admin interface, to return status in a specific format.

 * If admin commands are tried with the wrong password, the response is
   delayed, in order to limit brute force password cracking.

 * New configuration variable status-password, which protects the status
   admin command if it is set.

 * Admin commands can be used without a /cgi-bin part in the URL.
   So http://localhost:13000/cgi-bin/status can now become just
   http://localhost:13000/status.

 * New smsc configuration group variable 'allowed-smsc-id', which lets
   you limit which messages can be sent to a specific SMSC.

 * New architecture documentation.

 * New SMS testing tool called fake2.  It works like the old fakesmsc,
   but can be started and stopped while Kannel is running, which makes
   it easier to use.

 * New URL translation %k in smsbox, which is replaced with the keyword
   of the SMS request.

 * Improved portability to FreeBSD by using less stack space per thread.


Bugfixes:

 * The u-dieresis (u with two dots) was translated incorrectly to the
   GSM character set, in the AT, CIMD2, and SMPP drivers.  Fixed.

 * The EMI used to crash if username was not set.  Fixed.

 * WML compiler can handle a libxml that was compiled with
   the -DXML_USE_BUFFER_CONTENT flag.

 * WML compiler: If charset is not supplied in a WML file, the
   one from the HTTP content-type header is used instead, if available.

 * Fixed signal handling on Solaris and other systems with POSIX threads.


Development news:

 * New SMSC interface in the bearerbox, which should allow much faster
   implementations and better error handling.  There is a wrapper for
   the old interface, because no SMSC drivers have been converted yet.

 * New configuration file interface that uses Octstrs.

 * Work started on WAP Push.


Changes since version 0.13:


New features:

 * WTP and WSP protocol stacks are now separate, so that other projects
   than Kannel can make use of them.

 * Redesigned smsbox to have a stable number of threads.  It is much
   more stable now, handles more requests at a time, and shuts down
   more cleanly.

 * sendota interface accepts more than one OTA configuration.

 * Driver for UCP/EMI SMSCs supports authenticated sessions.

 * smsbox accepts WML responses as well as plain text and HTML responses.


Bugfixes:

 * Improved HTTP module's support for HTTP/1.0 clients and servers.

 * Fixed UDH encoding in Phone-as-SMSC module.

 * Fixed splitting of SMS messages that have UDH.

 * HTML to SMS conversion now deals with entities like &#1234; correctly.
   (Also fixed in 0.12.3)

 * Several bugs and memory leaks fixed in SMPP module.

 * Bearerbox detection of inactive SMSCs is less trigger-happy.
   This greatly improves throughput if the roundtrip to the SMSC is
   slower than 10 milliseconds.  (Also fixed in 0.12.3)

 * Detect libxml 2.2.10 and above as part of the 2.2.x series.
   (Also fixed in 0.12.3)

 * Fixed some memory leaks.


Development news:

 * Checking malloc now displays some of the contents of the memory leaks
   it finds, which makes it much easier to track them down.

 * Started building support for WAP Push.


Changes compared to version 0.12.3:


New features:

 * HTTP module restructured to use a fixed number of threads.  This makes
   it able to handle many more requests at a time.

 * Kannel boxes report version numbers of themselves and their components
   (such as libxml) when starting up.

 * Support for proxies that require basic authorization.

 * Bearerbox "status" command reports lengths of internal queues.

 * Phone-as-SMSC module now also supports Falcom A2D modem and Nokia 7110.

 * Added configure option --with-defaults=speed for production systems.

 * Updated documentation.

 * Bearerbox starts up faster.

 * sendsms interface can handle multiple requests over one HTTP/1.1
   connection.

 * Improved portability to HP/UX, FreeBSD and Cygwin, possibly others.

 * Support magic URL "kannel:alive", to check if the gateway is still running.

 * Support for PAM authentication of sendsms interface.

 * Sendsms interface checks that UDH messages have a correct length indicator.


Bugfixes:

 * Fixed several bugs in Phone-as-SMSC module.

 * Fixed the problem that switching malloc wrappers required a "make clean"
   when recompiling.


Development news:

 * Many files have been reformatted to our new coding style.

 * Renamed Msg type smart_sms to just sms.

 * New Dict module in gwlib, for Octstr -> value hash tables.

 * New FDSet module in gwlib, for efficient polling of large sets of
   file descriptors.  Used by HTTP module.  Connection module has
   extensions for it.


See ChangeLog for detailed information.
