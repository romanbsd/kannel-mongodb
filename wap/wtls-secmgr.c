 * gw/wtls-secmgr.c - wapbox wtls security manager
 *
 * The security manager's interface consists of two functions:
 *
 *      wtls_secmgr_start()
 *              This starts the security manager thread.
 *
 *      wtls_secmgr_dispatch(event)
 *              This adds a new event to the security manager's event
 *              queue.
 *
 * The wtls security manager is a thread that reads events from its event
 * queue, and feeds back events to the WTLS layer. Here is where various
 * approvals or rejections are made to requested security settings.
