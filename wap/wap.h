/*
 * wap.h - public interface to WAP protocol library
 *
 * The WAP protocol library consists of separate layers, which each run
 * in their own thread.  The layers are normally used together and will
 * communicate with each other, but they can be used separately by
 * specialized applications.
 *
 * Communication between layers is done by sending WAPEvent structures.
 * These events are passed to dispatch functions.  Each layer has its
 * own dispatch function which is responsible for queueing the event
 * for that layer.
 * 
 * The application using this library has to provide an application layer
 * and a datagram layer.  These layers do not have to be implemented in
 * any particular way and do not have to run in their own threads, but
 * they do have to provide dispatch functions.
 *
 * In general, if a layer receives an event that it does not know how
 * to handle, it will report this and ignore the event.
