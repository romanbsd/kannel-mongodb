 *
 * The WTLSMachine data structure preserves the state of the existing WTLS
 * transaction. The fields which are included;
 *
 * Machine identification: address four-tuple
 * Connection End : Server (1) or Client (2) This is always "server"
 *                                 (at least at the moment)
 * Bulk Cipher Algorithm : The algorithm to be used for stream or block encryption
 * Key Size : ?????
 * IV Size : The base IV used to calculate a record level IV for block ciphers running
 *                    in CBC mode for records sent by the server
 * MAC Algorithm : The algorithm identifier used for message authentication.
 * Master Secret : A shared secret between the two peers
 * Client Random : A random value supplied by the client
 * Server Random : A random value supplied by the server
 * Sequence Number Mode : Off (0), Implicit (1) or Explicit (2)
 * Key Refresh rate : New keys for MAC secret, IV and Encryption are calculated
 *                                   every "n", where n = 2^(RefreshRate)
 * Compression Method : The algorithm to compress data prior to encryption
