 * timers.h - interface to timers and timer sets.
 *
 * Timers can be set to elapse after a specified number of seconds
 * (the "interval").  They can be stopped before elapsing, and the
 * interval can be changed.
 *
 * An "output list" is defined for each timer.  When it elapses, an
 * event is generated on this list.  The event may be removed from
 * the output list if the timer is destroyed or extended before the
 * event is consumed.
 *
 * The event to use when a timer elapses is provided by the caller.
 * The timer module will "own" it, and be responsible for deallocation.
 * This will be true until the event has been consumed from the output
 * list (at which point it is owned by the consuming thread).
 * While the event is on the output list, it is in a gray area, because
 * the timer module might still take it back.  This won't be a problem
 * as long as you access the event only by consuming it.
 *
 * Timers work best if the thread that manipulates the timer (the
 * "calling thread") is the same thread that consumes the output list.
 * This way, it can be guaranteed that the calling thread will not
 * see a timer elapse after being destroyed, or while being extended,
 * because the elapse event will be deleted during such an operation.
 *
 * The timer_* functions have been renamed to gwtimer_* to avoid
 * a name conflict on Solaris systems.
