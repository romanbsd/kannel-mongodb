 * wtp_init_machine.def: macro call for generating WTP initiator state

 * it.
 *
 * By Aarno Syvänen for Wapit Ltd.
 *
 * WTPRespMachine data structure includes current state of WTP responder state 
 * machine for a specific transaction. This means all data needed to handle at
 * least two incoming events of a certain transaction. Its fields can be 
 * grouped following way:
 *
 * General:      a) wtp initiator machine state 
 *               b) tidnew flag, telling whether tid is wrapped up
 *
 * Fields telling the service required: 
 *               a) transaction class (is transaction confirmed or not) 
 *               b) user acknowledgement flag (do we wait for response 
 *                  primitive of WTP user (for instance, WSP) or not)
 *
 * Machine identification: address four-tuple and transaction identifier
 *
 * Fields required for reliable transmission: 
 *               a) pointer to the timer of this machine in the timers list
 *               b) counter for retransmissions 
 *               c) flag telling are we resending ack pdu doing tid verifica-
 *                  tion or not
 *               d) packed invoke message, for greater effectivity
