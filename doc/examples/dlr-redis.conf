# For Redis storage "table" is used as a key prefix for DLRs in the 
# format <table>:<smsc>:<ts>:<dst> (dst is not used on all smsc types). 
# It is also used as a key prefix storage of the number of pending DLRs
# in the format <table>:Count.
# If 'ttl' is set in seconds, then this is the time to live (TTL) for 
# a specific DLR entry in the keystore. (i.e. 7d = 60480s)
