/*
 * gwlib/counter.h - a counter object
 *
 * Kannel has monotonously growing counters in some places, and these need
 * to work even when several threads use them. This header defines the
 * type Counter that provides such a counter. The counter is a long, and
 * if it reaches LONG_MAX, it wraps around to zero (_NOT_ LONG_MIN).
 *
 * Lars Wirzenius.
 *
 * Changed the counter type 'long' into 'unsigned long' so it wraps
 * by itself. Just keep increasing it.
 * Also added a counter_increase_with function.
