/*
 * gwmem-check.c - memory management wrapper functions, check flavor
 *
 * This implementation of the gwmem.h interface checks for writes to
 * non-allocated areas, and fills freshly allocated and freshly freed
 * areas with garbage to prevent their use.  It also reports memory
 * leaks.
 *
 * Design: Memory is allocated with markers before and after the
 * area to be used.  These markers can be checked to see if anything
 * has written to them.  There is a table of all allocated areas,
 * which is used to detect memory leaks and which contains context
 * information about each area.
 *
 * The start marker contains the index into this table, so that it
 * can be looked up quickly -- but if the start marker has been damaged,
 * the index can still be found by searching the table.
 *
 * Enlarging an area with realloc is handled by allocating new area,
 * copying the old data, and freeing the old area.  This is an expensive
 * operation which is avoided by reserving extra space (up to the nearest
 * power of two), and only enlarging the area if the requested space is
 * larger than this extra space.  The markers are still placed at exactly
 * the size requested, so every realloc does mean moving the end marker.
 *
 * When data is freed, it is overwritten with 0xdeadbeef, so that code
 * that tries to use it after freeing will likely crash.  The freed area
 * is kept around for a while, to see if anything tries to write to it
 * after it's been freed.
 *
