 * list.h - generic dynamic list
 *
 * This is a generic, dynamic list. Generic means that it stores void pointers
 * (void *), instead of a more specific data type. This allows storage of
 * any type of items in the list. The pointers may not be NULL pointers.
 *
 * A number of operations are defined for the list: create, destroy,
 * query of length, inserting and deleting items, getting items, and so on.
 * See below for a detailed list.
 *
 * The list is also thread safe: each single operation is atomic. For
 * list manipulation that needs to be atomic but uses several single
 * operations, the list supports locking and unlocking. It is up to the
 * caller to make sure the list lock is used properly; the implementation
 * only guarantees the atomicity of single operations.
 *
 * The API also has functions for solving typical producer-consumer problems:
 * the list counts the number of producers it has (they need to register
 * _and_ unregister explicitly) and has functions for adding a produced
 * item to the list and removing an item so that it can be consumed. The
 * consumption function (`gwlist_consume') sleeps, without using processor
 * time, until there is an item to be consumed or there are no more
 * producers. Thus, a typical producer would look like this:
 *
 *	gwlist_add_producer(list);
 *	while ((item = foo()) != NULL)
 *		gwlist_produce(list, item);
 *	gwlist_remove_producer(list);
 *
 * and the corresponding consumer would look like this:
 *
 *	while ((item = gwlist_consume(list)) != NULL)
 *		bar(item);
 *
 * There can be any number of producers and consumers at the same time.
 *
 * List items are numbered starting with `0'.
 *
 * Most list functions can do memory allocations. If these allocations
 * fail, they will kill the program (they use gwlib/gwmem.c for
 * memory allocations, and those do the killing). This is not mentioned
 * explicitly for each function.
 *
 * The module prefix is `list' (in any combination of upper and lower case
 * characters). All externally visible symbols (i.e., those defined by
 * this header file) start with the prefix.
