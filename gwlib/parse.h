/*
 * parse.h - functions for octet-by-octet parsing of an octstr
 *
 * Interface to keep track of position in an octstr, and remember
 * error conditions so that they can be checked after a bunch of
 * calls.  Also allows temporary clipping of the string, so that
 * parsing doesn't go past a boundary until it's explicitly allowed
 * to.  This helps parse strings containing length-defined chunks.
 *
 * The main use of this interface is to simplify code that does
 * this kind of parsing, so that it can pass around a single
 * ParseContext value instead of an octstr and one or more offset
 * and length parameters.
 *
 * Note: The octstr involved MUST NOT change during parsing.
