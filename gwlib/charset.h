 * gwlib/charset.h - character set conversions
 *
 * This header defines some utility functions for converting between
 * character sets.  Approximations are made when necessary, so avoid
 * needless conversions.
 *
 * Currently only GSM and Latin-1 are supported with Kannel specific
 * functions. This module contains also wrappers for libxml2 character
 * set conversion functions that work either from or to UTF-8. More
 * about libxml2's character set support on the header file
 * <libxml/encoding.h> or the implementation file encoding.c. Short
 * version: it has a few basic character set supports built in; for
 * the rest iconv is used.
