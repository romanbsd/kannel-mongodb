/*
 * conn.h - declare Connection type to wrap a file descriptor
 *
 * This file defines operations on the Connection type, which provides
 * input and output buffers for a two-way file descriptor, such as a
 * socket or a serial device.
 *
 * The operations are designed for non-blocking use.  Blocking can be
 * done explicitly with conn_wait() or conn_flush().  A thread that
 * blocks in these functions can be woken up with gwthread_wakeup.
 *
 * The write operations will queue the data for sending.  They will
 * try to send whatever data can be sent immediately, if there's enough
 * of it queued.  "Enough" is defined by a value which can be set with
 * conn_set_output_buffering.  The caller must call either conn_wait
 * or conn_flush to actually send the data.
 *
 * The read operations will return whatever data is immediately
 * available.  If none is, then the caller should not simply re-try
 * the request (that would cause a busy-loop); instead, it should
 * wait for more data with conn_wait().
 *
 * The Connection structure has internal locks, so it can be shared
 * safely between threads.  There is a race condition in the interface,
 * however, that can cause threads to wait unnecessarily if there are
 * multiple readers.  But in that case there will always be at least one
 * thread busy reading.
 *
 * The overhead of locking can be avoided by "claiming" a Connection.
 * This means that only one thread will ever do operations on that
 * Connection; the caller must guarantee this.
 *
 * If any operation returns a code that indicates that the connection
 * is broken (due to an I/O error, normally), it will also have closed
 * the connection.  Most operations work only on open connections;
 * not much can be done with a closed connection except destroy it.

 * NOTE: Beware of concurrency issues.  The callback function will run
