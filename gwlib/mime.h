/*
 * mime.h - Implement MIME multipart/related handling 
 * 
 * References:
 *   RFC 2387 (The MIME Multipart/Related Content-type)
 *   RFC 2025 (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [MIME])
 *
 * Here we implement generic parsing functions to handle MIME multipart/related
 * messages. Our representation is made by the struct MIMEEntity where each
 * entity of the MIME scope is hold. Every entity should at least have headers.
 * If the body is a "normal" content-type, then it is stored in Octstr *body.
 * if the body is a sub-MIME multipart/related again, then it's single entities
 * are parsed and chained into the List *multiparts. Hence items in the list
 * are of type MIMEEntity again. We result in a recursive linked represenation
 * of the MIME multipart/related structure.
 *
 * We know about two various multipart types:
 *   multipart/mixed - where no "order" is associated among the entities
 *   multipart/related - where the "start" parameter in the Content-Type defines 
 *                       the semantically main processing entitiy in the set.
 *
 * In order to provide a mapping facility between the MIMEEntity representation
 * and an Octstr that holds the MIME document we have the two major functions
 * mime_octstr_to_entity() and mime_entity_to_octstr() that act as converters.
 *
 * Using the MIMEEntity representation structure it is easier to handle the 
 * subsequent MIME entities in case we have a cubed structure in the document.
