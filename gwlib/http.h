/*
 * http.h - HTTP protocol implementation
 *
 * This header file defines the interface to the HTTP implementation
 * in Kannel.
 * 
 * We implement both the client and the server side of the protocol.
 * We don't implement HTTP completely - only those parts that Kannel needs.
 * You may or may not be able to use this code for other projects. It has
 * not been a goal, but it might be possible, though you do need other
 * parts of Kannel's gwlib as well.
 * 
 * Initialization
 * ==============
 *
 * The library MUST be initialized by a call to http_init. Failure to
 * initialize means the library WILL NOT work. Note that the library
 * can't initialize itself implicitly, because it cannot reliably
 * create a mutex to protect the initialization. Therefore, it is the
 * caller's responsibility to call http_init exactly once (no more, no
 * less) at the beginning of the process, before any other thread makes
 * any calls to the library.
 * 
 * Client functionality
 * ====================
 * 
 * The library will invisibly keep the connections to HTTP servers open,
 * so that it is possible to make several HTTP requests over a single
 * TCP connection. This makes it much more efficient in high-load situations.
 * On the other hand, if one request takes long, the library will still
 * use several connections to the same server anyway.
 * 
 * The library user can specify an HTTP proxy to be used. There can be only
 * one proxy at a time, but it is possible to specify a list of hosts for
 * which the proxy is not used. The proxy can be changed at run time.
 * 
 * Server functionality
 * ====================
 * 
 * The library allows the implementation of an HTTP server by having
 * functions to specify which ports should be open, and receiving requests
 * from those ports.
 * 
 * Header manipulation
 * ===================
 * 
 * The library additionally has some functions for manipulating lists of
 * headers. These take a `List' (see gwlib/list.h) of Octstr's. The list
 * represents a list of headers in an HTTP request or reply. The functions
 * manipulate the list by adding and removing headers by name. It is a
 * very bad idea to manipulate the list without using the header
 * manipulation functions, however.
 *
 * Basic Authentication
 * ====================
 *
 * Basic Authentication is the standard way for a client to authenticate
 * itself to a server. It is done by adding an "Authorization" header
 * to the request. The interface in this header therefore doesn't mention
 * it, but the client and the server can do it by checking the headers
 * using the generic functions provided.
 *
 * Acknowledgements
 * ================
 *
 * Design: Lars Wirzenius, Richard Braakman
 * Implementation: Lars Wirzenius
