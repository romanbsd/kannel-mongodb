/*
 * octstr.h - Octet strings
 *
 * This header file declares an abstract data type, Octstr, for storing
 * and manipulating octet strings: strings of arbitrary binary data in
 * 8-bit bytes. Unlike C strings, they can contain the NUL byte ('\0').
 * Conceptually, they consist of a sequence of octets (bytes) and the
 * length of the sequence. There are various basic operations on octet
 * strings: concatenating, comparing, printing, etc.
 *
 * Octet strings come in two flavors: mutable and immutable. Mutable
 * octet strings are the normal kind and they can be modified and
 * otherwise manipulated at will. Immutable octet strings are meant to
 * be wrappers around a C string literal. They may not be modified, though
 * they may be destroyed.
 *
 * Immutable octet strings are meant to simplify usage of octet strings
 * together with C strings by reducing the number of octstr_* functions.
 * For example, we need a function for searching one string within another.
 * There needs to be different flavors of this: exact search, case-insensitive
 * search, and a search limited to the first N octets of the strings.
 * If in each of these one of the arguments may be either an octet string
 * or a C string, the number of functions doubles. Thus, we use immutable
 * strings instead:
 *
 *	octstr_search(os, octstr_imm("foo"), 0)
 *
 * The above looks like a memory leak, but it is not. Each immutable
 * octet string (i.e., with the same C string literal pointer) is really 
 * created only the first time, and octstr_destroy won't destroy it,
 * either. The immutable octet strings are destroyed automatically when
 * the process ends.
 *
 * See comments below for explanations on individual functions. Note that
 * all functions use gw_malloc and friends, so they won't return if the
 * memory allocations fail. Octet string functions are thread safe, as
 * long as they only one thread at a time operates on each octet string.
